   <p className='p1'> To us, flowers are a symbol of beauty, youth, purity, full of
    vitality, and carry many meanings. Flower petals, although soft,
    are extremely strong and are not lacking in the work
    of expressing possible emotions or sending sweet messages of
    love for life's harshest moments.
